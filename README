a. Name: Chen Xi

c. Write client to set TCP connection with AWS in file servers.
	and then AWS send received data to Server A, B, C also in servers.c through UDP packets.

e. First, open a terminal type "make all".
    Next, type "make servers" (because I used fork() in my code), 
    Then in another terminal type "./client sum ", "./client sos", "./client max", "./client min" respectively. Node: The nums.csv file should be in the same folder as Client.c and sercers.c

f. From client to AWS, it is integer array. 
   Between AWS and ServerA,B,C, it is String/Char array
   From AWS back to client, it is String/Char array

g. I did not find and fail situations so far. If you type ./client XXXX, I print a message to correct the input. I use 'int' to calculate, if the sum or sos > 2^32, the result may be incorrect.

h. No I did not.
